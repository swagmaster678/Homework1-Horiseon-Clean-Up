-Examples for the style.css:
* Eliminated duplicate class elements to organize css file.
* Organized the css file to follow the structure of the html file.
* Comments in style.css for specific examples of change.

-Examples for the index.html:
* Changed website title from "title" to "Horeison".
* Changed the <head> to <header> to follow requirements of semantic element.
* Added <article> tags to better organize paragraphs.
* Added alt= to all lines of code that had img src.
* Added "search-engine-optimization" id to the <div> tag so the link on webpage works.
* Changed the class names within the HTML to condense down the style.css file.
* Comments in the HTML file for specific examples of change.
